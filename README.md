## Features

blob-select has feature parity with the standard `<select>`, `<option>`, and `<optgroup>` attributes, including:
* `<select multiple=multiple>`
* `<option disabled=disabled>`

blob-select additionally provides support for:
* Placeholders
* Searching
* Sorting



## Requirements

blob-select does not require any Javascript frameworks, however browsers must support the following:
* [classList](http://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist)
* [querySelector](http://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector) + [querySelectorAll](http://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector)
* [JSON](http://caniuse.com/#search=JSON)

Broadly, this means all modern browsers are supported, and IE 10+. If these requirements are not met, blob-select will exit without manipulating the DOM.



## Use


### Installation

Download `dist/js/blobselect.min.js` and add it to your project folder, and include it somewhere on the page.

```html
<script src="/path/to/blobselect.min.js"></script>
```

Or via Composer:
```bash
composer require "blobfolio/blob-select:dev-master"
```

Or via Bower:
```bash
bower install blob-select
```


### Configuration

blob-select includes a few choice functional enhancements to the standard `select` browser object, but does not attempt to introduce every feature ever dreamt of by (wo)man or beast. These settings can be defined for each element in either of three ways:

```html
<!--
a single HTML attribute with chosen settings in a (valid!) JSON string
Note: the ' and " ordering
Note: if present, individual HTML attributes (see below) will be ignored
-->
<select data-blobselect='{"foo" : "bar", ...}'></select>

<!--
individual HTML attributes
format like: data-blobselect-{de-camelCased property name}
    e.g. set orderType via data-blobselect-order-type="..."
-->
<select data-blobselect-foo="bar"></select>

<!-- via Javascript -->
<script>
    document.getElementById('my-select').blobSelect({
        foo : "bar",
        ...
    });
</script>
```

The following settings are available:

> (*string*) **orderType**
> To have blob-select sort your `<option>`s, use *"string"* or *"numeric"* (according to the kind of data you're presenting). Otherwise, with the exception of "placeholders" (which always bubble to the top), ordering will be left alone.
> Default: *null*

> (*string*) **order**
> This option determines the sort order, either *"asc"* or *"desc"*. If *orderType* is not set, this option is ignored.
> Default: *"asc"*

> (*string*) **placeholder**
> This option overrides the text displayed when a "placeholder" `<option>` is selected. Any `<option>` without a label or with the attribute `data-placeholder="1"` is considered a "placeholder".
> Default: *"---"*

> (*string*) **placeholderOption**
> This works just like *placeholder*, but overrides the text displayed in the dropdown. If omitted, the *placeholder* setting will supply both.
> Default: *"---"*

> (*bool*) **search**
> To add a simple search field to the dropdown, set this value to *true*.
> Note: so as not to screw up your `<form>`, the search field is actually a contenteditable `<div>`.
> Default: *false*

> (*int*) **watch**
> This option will cause blob-select to manually re-examine your `<select>` element every *X* milliseconds to see if something has changed (and redraw itself as necessary).
> Note: this option should only be used in situations where element state changes are happening in hacky ways (like with AngularJS models). So long as outside scripts fire a `change` event, this is not needed.
> Default: *0* (i.e. disabled)

> (*bool*) **debug**
> When *true*, a lot of operational information is dumped to the console.log().
> Default: *false*


### Initialization

blob-select will automatically initialize any `<select>` elements on `DOMContentLoaded` that contain a `data-blobselect*` attribute. Alternatively, you can manually initialize an element at any time as follows:

```javascript
//regular ol' JS
document.getElementById('my-select').blobSelect.init({...});

//jQuery example
$('#my-select')[0].blobSelect.init({...});
```


### Destruction

To restore your page to its natural state, simply run:

```javascript
document.getElementById('my-select').blobSelect.destroy();
```



## Styling

blob-select aims to be as headache-free as possible. Its markup is minimal (see below) and it does not impose pesky inline styles, Javascript animations, or convoluted nested>nested>nested elements. Frontend developers are free to define everything through elegant CSS wizardry.

The HTML structure is as follows:

```html
<!--
.blobselect: the main container (don't add this class to your SELECT)
.is-multiple: if the select allows multiple values
.is-open: if the dropdown is open
.is-opening: a transitional class to allow you to e.g. animate from display: none
-->
<div class="blobselect">

    <!-- .blobselect-selections: selection(s) wrapper -->
    <div class="blobselect-selections">
    
        <!--
        .blobselect-selection: a selection
        .is-placeholder: if the selection is a placeholder option
        Note: multiselects can have more than one .blobselect-selection
        -->
        <div class="blobselect-selection" data-value="apples" data-label="Apples">Apples</div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- the original select -->
    <select name="foobar" id="foobar" class="foobar"> ... </select>

    <!--
    .blobselect-button: an extra element in case you need more than
    a :after to achieve the desired styling. Note: click events are bound
    on the entire .blobselect container, so you don't have to use this
    -->
    <div class="blobselect-button"></div>

    <!--.blobselect-items: the "dropdown" -->
    <div class="blobselect-items">
    
        <!--
        .blobselect-item-search: only present if "search"=true
        Note: this is a contenteditable <div>, not a true <input>
        Note: type="text" is appended to help it inherit CSS [type="text"]
        styles, but is otherwise functionless
        -->
        <div class="blobselect-item-search" type="text" contenteditable="true"></div>

        <!--
        .blobselect-item: an option
        .is-active: if the option is selected
        .is-placeholder: if the option is a placeholder
        .is-disabled: if the option is disabled
        .is-focused: if the option has focus via e.g. keyboard navigation
        .has-group: if the option is part of an optgroup
        .is-match: if "search"=true and this option matches the search
        .is-not-match: if "search"=true and this option does not match the search

        NOTE: a matched search substring will be wrapped in <mark> tags
            e.g. Op<mark>tion</mark> Label
        -->
        <div class="blobselect-item" data-value="option value" data-label="Option Label">Option Label</div>
        
        <!-- .blobselect-item-group: an optgroup -->
        <div class="blobselect-item-group">Fruit</div>
    </div>
</div>
```
